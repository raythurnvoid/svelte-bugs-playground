## Description

### Describe the bug

### Reproduction

Can confirm. This is also happening to a number of our selects.

### @Travja commented on Oct 23, 2024

Dependabot upgraded our project from 4.2.19 to 5.0.5 and I'm seeing this issue as well.

### @knd775 commented on Oct 23, 2024

It only happens when the component isn't in runes mode.

### @Travja commented on Oct 26, 2024 (edited)

I've been trying to make sure that everything is properly updated to Svelte 5 syntax for runes and everything but am still facing the issue. It's possible that I have more updating to do. My project is fairly complex with a lot of moving parts.

**Edit:** looks like I got things figured out.
